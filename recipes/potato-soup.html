    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This creamy potato soup is fit for a king - or the king of the gods! You'll impress anyone with this recipe that combines all the comforting flavors into one delicious, creamy dish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 strips bacon</li>
        <li>3 lbs russet potatoes, diced into large cubes</li>
        <li>2 large carrots, cut into large pieces</li>
        <li>2 tsp garlic, smooshed</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>4 cups broth, chicken or veggie</li>
        <li>spices, to taste.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the raw bacon into pieces and add to a pre-heated instant pot. Once cooked through, remove bacon, but keep most of the grease.</li>
        <li>Add onions to the bacon grease and cook until almost translucent. Then add garlic, for about 30 seconds, then all the broth, all the potatoes, all the carrots. Set to Cook for 15 mins on high.</li>
        <li>Once the IP is done cooking, let it do a natural pressure release for a few mins, then open it up.</li>
        <li>Your potatoes should be very soft, and starting to fall apart. Smash some of them up, or use a stick blender to lightly blend. Add the milk  and stir gently until combined.</li>
        <li>Serve in bowls with the bacon bits, and cheese, sour cream, green onions, and whatever else you like in a baked potato.</li>
    </ol>
